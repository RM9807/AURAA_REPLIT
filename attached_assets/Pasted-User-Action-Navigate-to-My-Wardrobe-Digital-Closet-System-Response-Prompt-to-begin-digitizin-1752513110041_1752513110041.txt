System Action: AI Analyzes Each Wardrobe Item

System Response: Present AI-Driven Declutter Recommendations
System Response: Organized view of declutter suggestions:
"Keep" Pile: Items perfectly aligned with their style profile.
"Consider Altering" Pile: Items that are a good style match but could be improved with minor alterations (e.g., "hem pants for better length").
"Consider Donating/Selling" Pile: Items that are a poor color match, unflattering fit, or completely misaligned with the new style.
Sub-feature: "Why This Doesn't Work" Explanation: For each "discard" or "alter" suggestion, AURA provides a brief, clear reason (e.g., "This color washes out your skin tone," "The cut of this jacket doesn't flatter your shoulder line").
Pain Point Addressed: Directly tackles the "get rid of 90% of my closet" challenge by providing specific, reasoned recommendations.
User Action: Review & Confirm Declutter Decisions
System Response: Users can override AI suggestions (e.g., "Keep anyway"), mark items for tailoring, or add them to a "discarded" list.
System Action: Update Digital Closet Inventory
System Response: The digital closet is updated, providing a clean, curated view of their current, optimal wardrobe.
